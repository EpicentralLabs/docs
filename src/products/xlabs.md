# xLABS – Revshare re-configured:
---
Introducing **xLABS**, our [staking](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/defi-staking-proof-of-stake-pos-coins) product that functions like buyback program - but with a twist! xLABS was designed to increase in price while simultaneously managing its total supply to prevent inflation. Best of all, its how users earn passive yield for staking in Epicentral Labs!

So, how *does* xLABS work??

### 1. The Staking:
Everything starts when a user stakes their [$LABS](https://www.epicentrallabs.com/labs-token) into the Epicentral DAO treasury [wallet.](https://app.realms.today/dao/LABS)  xLABS are instantly minted to the user’s wallet.

### 2. The Buying:
**75%** of OPX fees generated will be used to purchase xLABS directly from the market.  This creates a consistent *"buy"* pressure that naturally increases the value of xLABS for holders.

### 3. The Burning:
The xLABS purchased by OPX are then immediately burned.  This is a ***crucial*** step in two regards:
- Burning **combats** inflation by reducing xLABS circulating supply
- Burning xLABS also **provides** liquidity to the market directly

In summary, these three steps are executed as an automatic function of OPX and occur everytime a fee is generated.  Real-time purchasing reduces the price volatility of xLABS,and serves as a safeguard for holders by ensuring constant liquidity on the market – its like a *reverse* rugpull.  

Once the user feels like realizing their yield, they can simply swap xLABS for their desired currency thus completing the life cycle of a xLABS token. It's as simple as staking and selling! 

Users retains full ownership of their governance power and their staked $LABS throughout the entire time. $LABS can be unstaked at any time.
