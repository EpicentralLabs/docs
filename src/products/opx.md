# OPX
---
OPX is our DeFi Options Exchange and flagship product. This is the machine that makes everything function. The place where it all happens and where traders come to trade options for eligible Solana tokens. The Epicentral Labs DAO determines which currencies are eligible via [governance](https://www.epicentrallabs.com/dao).

The three words that best describe OPX are:

Design
Experience
Simplicity
Options-trading can be complicated enough. Epicentral Labs designed OPX specifically to be UI-friendly and information efficient. On the trading page you will see expiration dates, values, strike prices, and option “greeks” articulately displayed before you; Its all the information you could need without being overwhelmed.

This product should appeal to investors as well, because this is how OPX generates revenue. Fees are collected per transaction earning yield for xLABS holders (Insert link here).
