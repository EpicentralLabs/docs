# OPX
---
OPX is our Decentralized Options Exchange protocol and flagship product. Users engage with OPX to enter into, and exit from, options contracts - realizing their P&L's. 

The three words that best describe OPX are:

- Design
- Experience
- Simplicity

Options-trading can be complicated enough, so we designed OPX to be user-friendly - especially for first-time options traders. Yet, we also wanted to ensure that the technical metrics were concisely displayed so that seasoned traders could use it to their strategic advantage! 

On the trading page you will see values, strike prices, expiration dates and option “greeks” articulately displayed before you; Its all the information you could need without being overwhelmed.

## Revenue 
OPX generates revenue fees when users open and close their positions - please visit the [Fees](/products/fees.md) page for more details on how fees are calculated.   



## Token Eligibility
Epicentral Labs, DAO LLC members determine which tokens are eligible via trade on OPX by voting on proposals via [governance](/governance/governance).
