# Options: Basics - Introduction

**Options: Basics** is a short guide which you can learn from on how Options work and why they might be used. Epicentral Labs will have an advanced course discussing deeper material and potential trading strategies later down the road. For now though, let's start here:

## Prerequisites

**Understanding Options** can be rather tricky at first, especially if it's your first time hearing about it. We hope when reading this, that you have a general understanding of how trading in finance works. **To see if you are ready** to learn about Options, you should be able to fully explain the following:

- Bid/Ask
- Bullish/Bearish or Long/Short
- Market Order
- Limit Order
- Stop-Loss Order
- Hedging
- Financial Derivatives

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| <span style="color: #64acff">**Options**</span> | Financial derivatives of an underlying asset or token. They represent an agreement between a buyer and a seller for a potential future transaction at a predetermined price, known as the strike price. |
| <span style="color: #64acff">**Strike Price**</span> | The price at which the buyer can purchase (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset if the option is exercised. |
| <span style="color: #64acff">**Exercise**</span> | The act of using the option to buy (for calls) or sell (for puts) the underlying asset at the strike price. |
| <span style="color: #64acff">**Assignment**</span> | When the seller (writer) of an option is required to fulfill the obligation to sell or buy the underlying asset because the option holder has chosen to exercise. |
| <span style="color: #64acff">**Premium**</span> | The price paid by the buyer to purchase the option. This is essentially the "cost" of the option. |
| <span style="color: #64acff">**Expiration Date**</span> | The date by which the option must be exercised or it becomes void. After this date, the option expires and is worthless. |
