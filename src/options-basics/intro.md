# Learning the Foundation

<span style="color: #64acff">**Options - For Starters**</span> is a short guide which you can learn from on how Options work and why they might be used. Epicentral Labs will have an advanced course discussing deeper material and potential trading strategies later down the road. For now though, let's start here:

## Prerequisites

>**Understanding Options** can be rather tricky at first, especially if it's your first time hearing about it. We hope when reading this, that you have a general understanding of how trading in finance works. **To see if you are ready** to learn about Options, you should be able to fully explain the following:
>- Bid/Ask
>- Bullish/Bearish or Long/Short
>- Market Order
>- Limit Order
>- Stop-Loss Order
>- Hedging
>- Financial Derivatives

## What are Options?

>**Option Contracts are financial derivatives** of an underlying asset or token. They represent an agreement between a **buyer** and a **seller** for a potential future transaction at a predetermined price, known as the **Strike** price.

## How are Options Used?

### Trading

>Options are primarily used for trading purposes. Whether it be **price speculation**, **hedging** against a position, or seeking extra **income**. Options also can be used to create complex positions that involve buying and/or selling multiple contract "legs" at the same time, creating a **Spread** position. In forex trading, this is known as an FX Structure.

>>Overall, Options have a diverse quality about them, allowing traders and investors to further diversify their positions and market exposure.

### Incentives

>It isn't *always* about trading and making a quick buck here and there. Instead, Options can be utilized to set up great **incentive programs** for a team or organization. Because of the way Options are priced (discussed later), they can be cheap if bought far "Out of The Money" (OTM), meaning employers and team leadership can incentivize their organization to work towards milestones. 

>>Option incentive programs increase work ethic can bring value to a DAO and/or protocol which in turn, could drive up the value of an Option contract.
