# Options: Basics - Calls & Puts

This page will cover the basic foundation of **Call Options** and **Put Options**, how they work, and whether or not going **Long** or **Short** would be beneficial to a traders position.

# Long Options

A **Long Option** gives the Option Buyer *the right, but not the obligation*, to buy the underlying token at a set price, known as a [**Strike Price**](/options-basics/intro.html#terminology), within a specific time period.

In other words, the Option Buyer (going Long) doesn't have to necessarily wait until the [**expiration date**](/options-basics/intro.html#terminology) and could technincally sell to close their Option position outright if they please (realizing any gains or losses).

## Long Call Option (Bullish)

A **Long Call** generally means you specifically **purchased a Call Option.** This type of Option position is a bullish position, where you anticipate the price of the underlying token price to *increase*.

Using the **PNL Chart** above, you can see that if the Token Price *increases*, the value of the Call Option *increases*. 

The <span style="color: #00bf63">**Gain**</span> **is *unlimited***, whereas the <span style="color: #ff5757">**Loss**</span> **is *limited.*** 

::: tip üìù Note:
As an **Option Buyer**, you only risk losing whatever amount you paid in [**Premium**](/options-basics/intro.html#terminology), the price you paid for the option contract when you bought it.

## Long Put Option (Bearish)

A **Long Put** means you **purchased a Put Option.** This type of Option poisiton is a bearish position, where you anticipate the price of the underlying token price to *decrease*.

Using the **PNL Chart** above, you can see that if the Token Price *decreases*, the value of the Put Option *increases*.

The <span style="color: #00bf63">**Gain**</span> **is *unlimited*** (until underlying price hits $0), whereas the <span style="color: #ff5757">**Loss**</span> **is *limited.***

# Short Options

On the other side of the trade, an Options **Writer**, someone who **Shorts Options**, actually *has the obligation* to purchase the underlying tokens at a specified price **if** their Option position is assigned or waits until the expiration date. This is known as [**Assignment**](/options-basics/intro.html#terminology).

Although this sounds more advanced, it is also more risky. Since technically **it is possible to have an unlimited amount of loss** if there is no collateral backing the short position and if the direction of the underlying token price doesn't move in your favor.

## Short Call Option (Bearish)

A **Short Call** means you went Short on a Call Option. This is considered a bearish position since you anticipate the underlying token price to *decrease*. 

The best way to think of this is to imagine someone came up to you and asked to Buy a Call Option from *you!* You are the **Writer** for that contract and sold it to them for a [**Premium**](/options-basics/intro.html#terminology).

![ShortCallOptionCard](/Short_Call.png)

Using the **PNL Chart** above, you can see that if the Token Price *inreases*, the value of the Call Option *decreases*. However, your potential gains are capped up to the value of the premium you initially sold/shorted it for.

The <span style="color: #00bf63">**Gain**</span> **is *limited***, whereas the <span style="color: #ff5757">**Loss**</span> **is *unlimited.*** (until the underlying price hits $0)

::: tip üìù Note:
As an **Option Seller/Writer** it is possible to lose more than anticipated while your upside potential is being limited up to the Option Premium. Therefore, it is extremely risky if positions are not properly being monitored. It is also possible to get assigned earlier than anticipated if close to the Expiration Date and the underlying token price is near the strike price.

## Short Put Option (Bullish)

A **Short Put** means you went Short on a Put Option. This is considered a bullish position since you anticipate the underlying token price to *increase*.

Similar to the [Short Call](/options-basics/calls-and-puts.html#short-call-option-bearish), Selling a Put Option to a buyer, earns you the Premium of that Option Contract over time if the underlying price *increases*.

Using the **PNL Chart** above, you can see that if the Token Price *decreases*, the value of the Put Option *decreases*. However, your potential gains are capped up to the value of the premium you initially sold/shorted it for.

The <span style="color: #00bf63">**Gain**</span> **is *limited***, whereas the <span style="color: #ff5757">**Loss**</span> **is *unlimited.***
