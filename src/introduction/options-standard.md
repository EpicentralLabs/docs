# Solana Option Standard

The **Solana Option Standard (SOS)**, is an open source [Solana Program(s)](https://solana.com/docs/core/programs) SDK created by **Epicentral Labs**. The Option Standard allows for a "standardized" way to create **Option Contracts** on Solana, making it easier than ever to generate, calculate, and maintain options on-chain.

## The Problem

The **Solana Ecosystem** contains variety of different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and platforms -- many of which are decentralized exchanges (DEXs). However, what is interesting to see is despite Solana's low-barrier-of-entry for new users to get involved in the DeFi space and low transaction costs, Options don't seem to get a spotlight they deserve. 

Options are overlooked on Solana because of a few important reasons:

- They can be confusing and hard to understand for new traders and investors.
- Difficult to calculate correctly and fairly.
- Relies on centralized exchange orderbooks to calculate Option properties.
- Extensive quantitative finance and programming knowledge is required.
- Can be expensive to maintain.

## The Solution

**SOS** plans to resolve most of these issues. It is with no doubt however that options are confusing to understand.
