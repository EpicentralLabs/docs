# Solana Option Standard

The **Solana Option Standard (SOS)**, is an open source [Solana Program(s)](https://solana.com/docs/core/programs) library that created by Epicentral Labs. SOS based "Option Contracts" are generated, calculated, and utilized.

## The DeFi Ecosystem

The **Solana Ecosystem** contains variety of different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and platforms -- many of which are decentralized exchanges (DEX). Howerver, what is interesting to see is that despite Solana's low-barrier-of-entry for new users to get involved in the DeFi space and low transaction costs and speed, Options don't seem to get a spotlight they deserve...

Options are overlooked on Solana because of a few important reasons because they are:

- Confusing and hard to understand for new traders and investors.
- Difficult to calculate correctly and fairly.
- Relies on centralized exchange orderbooks to calculate Option properties.
- Extensive quantitative finance and programming knowledge is required.
- Can be expensive to maintain.
