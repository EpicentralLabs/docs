# The Solana Options Standard (SOS)

<span style="color: #64acff">**Solana Options Standard (SOS)** is an open source [Solana Program(s)](https://solana.com/docs/core/programs) SDK created by **Epicentral Labs**. Allowing for a "standardized" way to create **Option Contracts** on Solana, making it easier than ever to generate, calculate, and integrate Options on-chain.</span>

## The Problem

The [**Solana Ecosystem**](https://solana.com/) contains variety of different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and platforms -- many of which are exchanges (DEXs). However, what is interesting to see is that despite Solana's low-barrier-of-entry for users to get involved in the DeFi space thanks to low transaction costs and high speed, Options don't seem to get the spotlight they deserve. 

**Options are overlooked** on Solana because of a few important reasons:

- They can be **confusing** and hard to understand for new traders and investors.
- **Difficult** to calculate correctly and fairly.
- Relies on **centralized** exchange orderbooks to calculate Option properties.
- **Extensive** quantitative finance and programming knowledge is required.

## The Solution

The Option Standard will help fix most of these of these issues. With the sole purpose for developers to be able to utilize the **Solana Option Standard SDK** and implement potential solutions into their projects or platforms.

The purpose of **SOS** is to create a more hassle-free and less time-consuming way to create Option Contracts (and even Option Chains) on Solana. This standard brings in the most important financial derivative into the spotlight which lacks significantly on Solana. We can dive a bit deeper into what **Options Standard SDK** looks to solve in [The Option Standard](/introduction/the-option-standard) page!
