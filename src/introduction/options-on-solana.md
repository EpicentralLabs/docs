# Options on Solana

PLACEHOLDER

## Decentralized Options

**In the** [**New York Stock Exchange**](https://www.nyse.com/index), cash-heavy investors and financial institutions help "make the market" by creating liquidity in the options market. 

Those individual investors and financial institutions are limited by various rules set by different exchanges, clearing firms, and government regulators -- which is about as centralized as you can get when it comes to finance -- and that isn't entirely a bad thing either since it promotes safety and fairness *(not that it is or isn't)*.

>What if there was a way to promote **safety** as well as **fairness** thanks to Solana's infrustructure?
>>There is! So, let's break it down:

## Solana Options Standard (SOS)

The <span style="color: #64acff">**Solana Options Standard (SOS)**</span> is an open source [Solana Program(s)](https://solana.com/docs/core/programs) **SDK** created by [Epicentral Labs](/epicentral-labs/about). Allowing for a "standardized" way to create **Option Contracts** on Solana, making it easier than ever to generate, calculate, and integrate Options on-chain.

### Open Source

>The **Solana Options Standard** by **Epicentral Labs** is an open source program development kit (SDK) consisting of different libraries, modules, and pre-made mathematical derivative functions that allow developers to build or implement custom or standardized option contracts on Solana. 

>>**SOS** is not limited by what Epicentral Labs may create, instead -- the SDK is fully accessible by all. 

### Why Solana?

>Thanks to Solana's incrediblely fast transaction speed, inexpensive transaction cost, and proof-of-history (PoH) transaction validation, it allows for a much faster network for options to exist on. This eliminates unfair low-latency advantages like in the New York Stock Exchange while simutaneously promoting safety to all who interact with an Option Program. - [*Learn more about Solana*](https://solana.com/).

## The Problem

The [**Solana Ecosystem**](https://solana.com/) contains variety of different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and platforms -- many of which are exchanges (DEXs). However, what is interesting to see is that despite Solana's low-barrier-of-entry for users to get involved in the DeFi space thanks to low transaction costs and high speed, Options don't seem to get the spotlight they deserve. 

**Options are overlooked** on Solana because of a few important reasons:

- They can be **confusing** and hard to understand for new traders and investors.
- **Difficult** to calculate correctly and fairly.
- Relies on **centralized** exchange orderbooks to calculate Option properties.
- **Extensive** quantitative finance and programming knowledge is required.

## The Solution

The Option Standard will help fix most of these of these issues. With the sole purpose for developers to be able to utilize the **Solana Option Standard SDK** and implement potential solutions into their projects or platforms.

The purpose of **SOS** is to create a more hassle-free and less time-consuming way to create Option Contracts (and even Option Chains) on Solana. This standard brings in the most important financial derivative into the spotlight which lacks significantly on Solana. We can dive a bit deeper into what **Options Standard SDK** looks to solve in [The Option Standard](/introduction/the-option-standard) page!

## Expanding DeFi

Assuming you have a general understanding of financial markets, derivatives (such as futures and options), and the Solana Blockchain -- let's break down the most overlooked part of DeFi on Solana and explain how **Epicentral Labs** aims to bring the most popular-traded financial derivative on-chain.
