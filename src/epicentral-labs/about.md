# Epicentral Labs

Epicentral Labs is a **development studio** with its core team spread across the US & Canada, along with global outside collaborators and contributors. 

Our focus is on the [**Solana Blockchain**](https://solana.com/), utilizing its fast network and low-cost transactions to develop solutions for Solana while also aligning with [Our Missions](/epicentral-labs/about#our-missions)

## Our Missions (CAVE)

### C ~ Grow a Community 

As always, it's fun to do things with others! Building a community surrounding our missions brings extra level of excitement that everyone needs. 

We hope to build a community filled with like-minded developers and traders looking to provide **value**, ensure **authenticity**, and offer **education** about Solana.

### A ~ Stay Authentic

Unfortunately, cryptocurrency gets bad rep... and we want to fix that. 

By providing authentic **communication**, **transaparency**, and **genuine collaborations**, we can fix what once was "sketchy" and turn it into something that non-crypto user can have a more open-mind to.

### V ~ Provide Value

We wish to **bring value** to Solana. When we say "value", we don't necessarily mean financial, we are instead focusing on the qualitative aspects of Solana. 

By focusing deeply on a unique problem, Epicentral Labs aims to accomplish small but impactful solutions on-chain.

### E ~ Offer Education

Knowledge is power. Without it, you are weak. As brutal as that may sound, Epicentral Labs looks forward to **being a greatly supportive space** where new and experienced Solana users can learn more about the ecosystem, program development, and trading strategies.

## Our Focuses

### Solana Options Standard

[**The Solana Options Standard (SOS)**](/introduction/options-standard) is an open source [Solana Program(s)](https://solana.com/docs/core/programs) SDK created by **Epicentral Labs**. Allowing for a "standardized" way to create **Option Contracts** on Solana, making it easier than ever to generate, calculate, and integrate options on-chain.
