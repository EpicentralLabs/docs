# Options Pricing Model (**OPM**)
---
Within the SOS_SDK infrastructure is the “Option Pricing Model”. OPM is carefully calculated by being heavily based off the Black-Scholes Model (BSM). We use the BSM because it is proven to be consistent and reliable formula for derivative pricing. This formula is used daily in TradFi for option contracts creations and for other derivative pricings. However, given the nature of cryptocurrency, we had to carefully invent a structure within OPM that would conform the principles of TradFi options-trading to the DeFi ecosystem and Web3 environments. This includes establishing the following principles:

Fractionalized Options must exist for both Buyers and Sellers:
In TradFi, contracts are subjected to 100x of the underlying asset. Thanks to OPM, users can now customize the exact amount they want to trade. Additionally, fractionalization allows users to create efficient strategies that can help them hedge. I.e, instead of spending $300 for one contract representing 100x shares for a call, you can now enter the same contract for $150 representing 50x of the shares for the call, and use any of the remainder amount to purchase a put. If done correctly the user can set themselves up for a [win-win](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+iron+condor+strategy%3F&sca_esv=d6b7cd5f9271c9c7&ei=LohFaPLED_2VwbkP0OOssAY&ved=0ahUKEwjyk8_J7-GNAxX9SjABHdAxC2YQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=what+is+the+iron+condor+strategy%3F&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiIXdoYXQgaXMgdGhlIGlyb24gY29uZG9yIHN0cmF0ZWd5PzIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yCxAAGIAEGIYDGIoFMgsQABiABBiGAxiKBTIIEAAYgAQYogQyCBAAGIAEGKIESIoMUPUEWPUEcAF4AZABAJgBZaABZaoBAzAuMbgBA8gBAPgBAZgCAqACd8ICChAAGLADGNYEGEeYAwCIBgGQBgiSBwMxLjGgB4QEsgcDMC4xuAduwgcFMi0xLjHIBw4&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) scenario. This concept can only be done for DeFi options markets as the options themselves are tokenized on-chain thus allowing for the same market exposure.
